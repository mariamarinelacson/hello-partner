					<pre>My partner's name is Shiela Zaguirre. She is 19 years old and was born on November 11, 1997. This is my description of her based on her looks and gestures: she has been my classmate for several subjects now and I know she is quiet because she does not talk a lot. But maybe, when she is with her friends, you can she the other side of her. I can relate because I am also quiet but tend to be talkative when with my friends. I am not sure how well she does in school, I do not really notice those kinds of attitudes. Doing well or not in academics does not define who a person really is. It is based on how you treat people and possible, how one can handle challenges.

					According to her, these are the short descriptions about her: she is caring, sweet, diligent and soft hearted but she is willing to learn from every experiences she encounters, the challenges and hardships. She likes to hangout with friends often but a very introvert person. Recently, she is so into K-drama but when it is time for studies, she focuses on academics. She likes to help people a lot and she really cherish each moment of life. She likes to read some books like fiction, or anything about history. More descriptions about her (according to her friend) is that she is down to earth, God fearing, thoughtful, shy, treasures friendships and unfortunately, she does not know her full potential YET. 

					This is her educational background:

					Year: 2001 - 2004
